However, he also has high air speed (tied with Sonic, Donkey Kong, Little Mac and Inkling for the 12th fastest) and jump height, but in exchange for poor range and low traction. \"},{id:2,name:\"Donkey Kong\",series:\"Donkey Kong\",images:DonkeyKong,description:\"Donkey Kong is unsurprisingly a large super heavyweight, having the same weight value as King Dedede, and is the third-heaviest character in the game behind Bowser and King K. Rool. Despite this, he is one of the faster heavyweights in the game: his ground speed, aerial movement and attack speed are all quite fast, as he has the 9th fastest walking speed and the 28th fastest dashing speed, above average falling speed and gravity, and is tied with Mario, Sonic, Little Mac, and Inkling for the 12th fastest air speed, but in contrast has below average air acceleration.\"},{id:3,name:\"Link\",series:\"Legend of Zelda\",images:Link,description:\"Link is a heavyweight swordsman that sports powerful attacks and long range via the Master Sword. Link sports an above-average walking speed, the 15th slowest dashing speed, above-average initial dash, is tied with Diddy Kong for the 10th slowest air speed, the 4th slowest air acceleration, above-average gravity and falling speed, the 6th highest fast falling speed, and above-average traction. Lastly, Link has among the lowest jump heights in the game. Overall, these stats render Link's mobility generally poor.\"},{id:4,name:\"Samus\",series:\"Metroid\",images:Samus,description:\"Samus has historically been a lower-ranking character in the Smash Bros. series, with most of her incarnations (except Melee and post-patch SSB4) infamously considered low tier in their respective games. Even after being heavily buffed via patches, at the end of SSB4's metagame, Samus ended up as a low-mid tier character (tied with Robin for 37th out of 55). Likely as a result of this, Samus has been significantly buffed overall in the transition to Ultimate.\"},{id:5,name:\"Dark Samus\",series:\"Metroid\",images:DarkSamus,description:\"As with certain other Echo Fighters, Dark Samus is nearly identical gameplay-wise to Samus, with largely aesthetic differences. However, she has many basic animations that are different from Samus, a more standard roll which does not involve turning into a Morph Ball, electric effects instead of fire effects for most of Samus's fire-based moves, and different models for both the Morph Ball and Missile.\"},{id:6,name:\"Yoshi\",series:\"Yoshi\",images:Yoshi,description:\"Yoshi is a heavyweight fighter with above-average mobility, good frame data, and decent KO potential. He sports a unique shield in the form of a Yoshi Egg, which generally lasts longer than most shields and is larger in size; thus, it does a good job of protecting Yoshi from powerful attacks.\"},{id:7,name:\"Kirby\",series:\"Kirby\",images:Kirby,description:\"Kirby is known for being a small lightweight, being tied for the eighth lightest character in the game. True to his franchise, Kirby is a slow, yet floaty character in the air, but has average ground speed. He has the twenty-first slowest walking speed, fortieth fastest dashing speed, and a decently quick initial dash. He also has the fifth slowest air speed, fifteenth highest air acceleration, third lowest gravity, the fourth lowest falling and fast falling speeds, and above average traction.\"},{id:8,name:\"Fox\",series:\"Star Fox\",images:Fox,description:\"Fox is a lightweight, hit-and-run type character with excellent grounded mobility and good frame data for the majority of his moveset. Fox is incredibly mobile: he possesses the fifth-fastest dashing speed, third-fastest walking speed, 32nd fastest air speed, 21st highest air acceleration, the highest falling (and thus fast falling) speed and gravity in the game, with the latter two allowing him to quickly move from the air to the ground with ease. These attributes allow him to keep up with almost any opponent while additionally making him very difficult to punish.\"},{id:9,name:\"Pikachu\",series:\"Pokemon\",images:Pikachu,description:\"Pikachu is a small lightweight, tied with Kirby, Olimar, and Mewtwo for the seventh lightest fighter. It has overall good mobility, possessing fast walking and dashing speeds, high jumps, is tied for the ninth-highest air acceleration and has the fourth-highest traction, but slightly above average falling speed and gravity and below-average airspeed. Due to its fast mobility, a good projectile in Thunder Jolt, a good frame data and some of the fastest defensive options, Pikachu has a good approach and great neutral game.\"},{id:10,name:\"Luigi\",series:\"Super Mario\",images:Luigi,description:\"Luigi is a middleweight who is somewhat floaty and has attributes that deviate from most characters of his weight class. Luigi has average walking and dashing speeds, the second slowest air speed, average air acceleration, slightly below average gravity, slow falling speed and fast falling speed and low traction. Luigi also sports a very high jump and double jump, among the highest in the game.

While his three projectiles allow for some zoning, he truly excels at short distances, where he can overwhelm opponents with fast aerials, steady shield pressure, and punishing throws. Ness' overall mobility is rather one-sided: on the ground his walking speed, initial dash, and dash speed are below average, but his aerial movement shines thanks to his excellent air acceleration, decent air speed, and above-average jump height.\"},//STOPPED HERE\n{id:12,name:\"Captain Falcon\",series:\"F-Zero\",images:Captain},{id:73,name:\"Banjo & Kazooie\",series:\"Banjo Kazooie\",images:Banjo},{id:75,name:\"Byleth\",series:\"Fire Emblem\",images:Byleth}];","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/sonic/Desktop/smash-ultimate-character-roster/src/characters.js"],"names":["Mario","DonkeyKong","Link","Samus","DarkSamus","Yoshi","Kirby","Fox","Pikachu","Luigi","Ness","Captain","Banjo","Byleth","characters","id","name","series","images","description"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAOA,CAAAA,KAAP,KAAmB,oBAAnB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,UAAP,KAAwB,yBAAxB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,IAAP,KAAkB,mBAAlB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,KAAP,KAAmB,oBAAnB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,SAAP,KAAuB,yBAAvB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,KAAP,KAAmB,oBAAnB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,KAAP,KAAkB,oBAAlB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,GAAP,KAAgB,kBAAhB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,OAAP,KAAoB,sBAApB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,KAAP,KAAmB,oBAAnB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,IAAP,KAAiB,mBAAjB,CAEA,MAAOC,CAAAA,OAAP,KAAqB,4BAArB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,KAAP,KAAkB,oBAAlB,CACA,MAAOC,CAAAA,MAAP,KAAmB,qBAAnB,CAGA,MAAO,IAAMC,CAAAA,UAAU,CAAG,CACtB,CACIC,EAAE,CAAE,CADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,OAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,aAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAElB,KAJZ,CAKImB,WAAW,CAAE,2aALjB,CADsB,CAStB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,CADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,aAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,aAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEjB,UAJZ,CAKIkB,WAAW,CAAE,8jBALjB,CATsB,CAiBtB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,CADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,MAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,iBAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEhB,IAJZ,CAKIiB,WAAW,CAAE,sgBALjB,CAjBsB,CAyBtB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,CADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,OAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,SAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEf,KAJZ,CAKIgB,WAAW,CAAE,idALjB,CAzBsB,CAiCtB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,CADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,YAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,SAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEd,SAJZ,CAKIe,WAAW,CAAE,uZALjB,CAjCsB,CAyCtB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,CADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,OAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,OAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEb,KAJZ,CAKIc,WAAW,CAAE,uSALjB,CAzCsB,CAiDtB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,CADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,OAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,OAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEZ,KAJZ,CAKIa,WAAW,CAAE,ofALjB,CAjDsB,CAyDtB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,CADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,KAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,UAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEX,GAJZ,CAKIY,WAAW,CAAE,6jBALjB,CAzDsB,CAiEtB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,CADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,SAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,SAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEV,OAJZ,CAKIW,WAAW,CAAE,ghBALjB,CAjEsB,CAyEtB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,EADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,OAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,aAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAET,KAJZ,CAKIU,WAAW,CAAE,mfALjB,CAzEsB,CAiFtB,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,EADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,MAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,YAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAER,IAJZ,CAKIS,WAAW,CAAE,yfALjB,CAjFsB,CAyFtB;AAGA,CACIJ,EAAE,CAAE,EADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,gBAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,QAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEP,OAJZ,CA5FsB,CAoGtB,CACII,EAAE,CAAE,EADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,iBAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,eAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEN,KAJZ,CApGsB,CA2GtB,CACIG,EAAE,CAAE,EADR,CAEIC,IAAI,CAAE,QAFV,CAGIC,MAAM,CAAE,aAHZ,CAIIC,MAAM,CAAEL,MAJZ,CA3GsB,CAAnB","sourcesContent":["import Mario from  \"./images/Mario.png\";\nimport DonkeyKong from  \"./images/DonkeyKong.png\";\nimport Link from  \"./images/Link.png\";\nimport Samus from  \"./images/Samus.png\";\nimport DarkSamus from  \"./images/Dark-Samus.png\";\nimport Yoshi from  \"./images/Yoshi.png\";\nimport Kirby from \"./images/Kirby.png\";\nimport Fox from \"./images/Fox.png\";\nimport Pikachu from \"./images/Pikachu.png\";\nimport Luigi from  \"./images/Luigi.png\";\nimport Ness from \"./images/Ness.png\";\n\nimport Captain from  \"./images/CaptainFalcon.png\";\nimport Banjo from \"./images/Banjo.png\";\nimport Byleth from \"./images/Byleth.png\";\n\n\nexport const characters = [\n    {\n        id: 1,\n        name: \"Mario\",\n        series: \"Super Mario\",\n        images: Mario,\n        description: \"Mario is a short middleweight with relatively balanced attributes, possessing average walking speed and air acceleration, above average dashing speed and weight, while his falling speed and gravity are slightly below average relative to the cast.
